  <BODY>
    The <CODE>com.slamd.asn1</CODE> package contains code for encoding and
    decoding ASN.1 data using the Basic Encoding Rules (BER) format.  This
    encoding is used for communication between the SLAMD server and the
    various clients, as well as storing certain kinds of data (e.g., job
    statistics) in the configuration directory.

    Note that this is not a complete ASN.1 implementation -- most elements are
    included, but those elements not used by either SLAMD or the LDAP protocol
    (e.g., OIDs, time values, etc.) are not implemented.  The following ASN.1
    elements are supported:

    <UL>
      <LI>Generic ASN.1 elements</LI>
      <LI>Boolean elements (type 0x01)</LI>
      <LI>Integer elements (type 0x02)</LI>
      <LI>Octet string elements (type 0x04)</LI>
      <LI>Null elements (type 0x05)</LI>
      <LI>Enumerated elements (type 0x0A)</LI>
      <LI>Sequence elements (type 0x30)</LI>
      <LI>Set elements (type 0x31)</LI>
    </UL>
