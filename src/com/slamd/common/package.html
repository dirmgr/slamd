  <BODY>
    The <CODE>com.slamd.common</CODE> package contains code used throughout
    SLAMD.  This code is used not only by the server but also by the client,
    client manager, resource monitor client, and real-time statistics reporting
    clients.  In particular, the <CODE>Constants</CODE> class defines a number
    of constant values that are used virtually everywhere.  This package also
    contains code for utility classes that didn't really fit in any other
    package.
