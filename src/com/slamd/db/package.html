  <BODY>
    The <CODE>com.slamd.db</CODE> package contains the code for interacting
    with the embedded database.  This database stores all configuration and
    job data.  The embedded database used is the Berkeley DB Java Edition, which
    is not a relational database but rather a BTree database, so it is not
    accessed via JDBC and data is not stored in rows and columns, but rather
    each database operates very much like a <CODE>java.util.TreeMap</CODE> in
    which elements are sorted key-value pairs that may be get and put as
    necessary.
