  <BODY>
    The <CODE>com.slamd.http</CODE> package contains the SLAMD HTTP client
    library.  This library provides a number of methods for interacting with
    Web servers using HTTP and HTTPS via HTTP 1.1.  It provides support for
    cookies, authentication, proxy servers, redirects, and keepalive.  It also
    provides basic support for parsing HTML documents and can be configured to
    automatically retrieve associated files (e.g., images, framesets, remote
    stylesheets, etc.) so that it operates more like a real Web browser.
