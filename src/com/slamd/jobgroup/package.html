  <BODY>
    The <CODE>com.slamd.jobgroup</CODE> package contains data structures and
    logic for dealing with job groups.  A job group is a set of jobs and/or
    optimizing jobs that may be scheduled as a single entity.  When adding a job
    to a job group, parameters for that job may be mapped to common parameters
    defined in the job group or they may be given fixed values.  Dependencies
    may be defined between the jobs and/or optimizing jobs in the job group to
    ensure that the jobs run in a particular order (although it is also possible
    to have multiple jobs running concurrently).
