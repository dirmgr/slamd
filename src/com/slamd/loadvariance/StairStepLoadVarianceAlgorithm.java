/**
 * This class defines a load variance algorithm that may be used to increase or
 * decrease the number of active threads in spurts rather than gradually over
 * time.  That is, all the threads to enable or disable will be notified at the
 * very beginning of the interval with no change over the duration of that
 * interval.  That is, the graph will appear to have an initial jump up or down
 * but then will remain level for the duration of the interval associated with
 * that line.  The change in the number of active threads may be specified in
 * one of the following ways:
 * <UL>
 *   <LI>"+N", where N is a fixed number of threads to start at the beginning of
 *       this load variation.</LI>
 *   <LI>"-N", where N is a fixed number of threads to stop at the beginning of
 *       this load variation.</LI>
 *   <LI>"+N%", where N% is a percentage of the overall number of threads per
 *       client that should be started at the beginning of this load
 *       variation.</LI>
 *   <LI>"-N%", where N% is a percentage of the overall number of threads per
 *       client that should be stopped at the beginning of this load
 *       variation.</LI>
 *   <LI>"=N", where N is the fixed number of threads that should be running
 *       once this load variation completes.</LI>
 *   <LI>"=N%", where N% is a percentage of the overall number of threads per
 *       client that should be running once this load variation completes.</LI>
