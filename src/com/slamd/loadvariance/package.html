  <BODY>
    The <CODE>com.slamd.loadvariance</CODE> package contains the code for
    the SLAMD load variance capabilities.  This makes it possible to vary the
    load against the target application while a job is running by altering the
    number of active threads according to a user-provided pattern.  Various
    algorithms may be used to control the rate at which threads are activated
    and deactivated.
