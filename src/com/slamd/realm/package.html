  <BODY>
    The <CODE>com.slamd.realm</CODE> package contains the code that is used
    to define a custom access control realm in the Apache Tomcat servlet engine.
    In particular, a realm is defined that makes it possible to authenticate
    users against an LDAP directory server in a way that is more powerful and
    flexible than the mechanism offered in the default <CODE>JNDIRealm</CODE>
    implementation provided with Tomcat.
