/**
 * This class defines a special kind of script exception that may be thrown if a
 * break instruction is encountered inside a loop.  The break exception
 * indicates that the execution of the loop should terminate and that executions
 * should resume at the first instruction immediately after the end of the loop.
 * It is necessary to implement this as an exception because a loop may have
 * multiple depths of instructions and when the break is called it will be
 * necessary to break out of all of them.  To deal with the performance penalty
 * that can be associated with exceptions (particularly, filling in the stack
 * trace which is not even important in this case), a static singleton instance
 * will be created that should be thrown instead of creating a new break
 * exception every time.
