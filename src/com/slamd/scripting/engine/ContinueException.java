/**
 * This class defines a special kind of script exception that may be thrown if a
 * continue instruction is encountered inside a loop.  The continue exception
 * indicates that the execution of the current loop iteration should terminate
 * and that the next iteration should start if appropriate.  To deal with the
 * performance penalty that can be associated with exceptions (particularly,
 * filling in the stack trace which is not even important in this case), a
 * static singleton instance will be created that should be thrown instead of
 * creating a new continue exception every time.
