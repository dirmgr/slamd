Download Instructions

Using your browser, download the appropriate executable(s) or tar.gz files
from the download page to the location where you want to temporarily store
them.

The download has been broken into two archives for convenience. The first
archive contains the JAI library itself and is required in order to run JAI.
The second archive contains sample code and images that may optionally be
downloaded in order to demonstrate some of the functionality of JAI.

Installation Instructions

   * Solaris Operating Environment Installation Instructions

     For the SPARC edition, the download files are:
        o jai-1_1_2_01-lib-solaris-sparc-jdk.bin
        o jai-1_1_2_01-lib-solaris-sparc-jre.bin
        o jai-1_1_2_01-lib-solaris-sparc.tar.gz
     For the Intel edition, they are:
        o jai-1_1_2_01-lib-solaris-i586-jdk.bin
        o jai-1_1_2_01-lib-solaris-i586-jre.bin
        o jai-1_1_2_01-lib-solaris-i586.tar.gz
     Assuming:

          $JDK       is the path into the jdk1.3 (or a higher version),
          $downloaddir  is the directory into which you downloaded the .bin files.

     To install the JDK version for Solaris:
        o If you are on a SPARC-based system, run the commands:

          % cd $JDK
          % chmod u+x $downloaddir/jai-1_1_2_01-lib-solaris-sparc-jdk.bin
          % $downloaddir/jai-1_1_2_01-lib-solaris-sparc-jdk.bin

        o If you are on an Intel-based system, run the commands:

          % cd $JDK
          % chmod u+x $downloaddir/jai-1_1_2_01-lib-solaris-i586-jdk.bin
          % $downloaddir/jai-1_1_2_01-lib-solaris-i586-jdk.bin

     You may answer 'yes' to any questions about replacing files. You may
     delete the jai-1_1_2_01-*.bin files after you are done with the
     extraction.

     IMPORTANT: If you do not "cd" to the JDK1.3 (or higher version)
     directory before performing the extraction, then JAI will not work
     correctly. You may also need appropriate write permissions into the JDK
     directory in order to install.

     To install the JRE version for Solaris:

           % cd $JRE         ($JRE is the path into jre1.3 or later version.)

        o If you are on a SPARC-based system, run the commands:

          % chmod u+x $downloaddir/jai-1_1_2_01-lib-solaris-sparc-jre.bin
          % $downloaddir/jai-1_1_2_01-lib-solaris-sparc-jre.bin

        o If you are on an Intel-based system, run the commands:

          % chmod u+x $downloaddir/jai-1_1_2_01-lib-solaris-i586-jre.bin
          % $downloaddir/jai-1_1_2_01-lib-solaris-i586-jre.bin

     To view an html page containing an (JAI or other optional package)
     applet, the Java Plug-in must also be registered with the browser as
     described at
     http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/install-solaris.html#plugin.

     IMPORTANT: If you do not "cd" to the JRE1.3 (or higher version)
     directory before performing the extraction, then JAI will not work
     correctly. You may also need appropriate write permissions into the JRE
     directory in order to install.

   * CLASSPATH Installation Instructions for Solaris/Linux Platforms

     The tar.gz downloads are installations which do not check for the JDK
     or the JRE and install into a directory called jai-1_1_2_01 by default.
     CLASSPATH needs to be set to point to the jar files in this directory.

     Assuming:

          $PLATFORM   is the specific platform (solaris-sparc/solaris-i586/linux-i586)

          $JAIDIR is the directory into which the JAI files are to be
          installed
     To install, change directories to $JAIDIR, unzip, untar, and set
     CLASSPATH as follows:

          % cd $JAIDIR
          % gunzip -c $downloaddir/jai-1_1_2_01-lib-($PLATFORM).tar.gz | tar xf -

     Set CLASSPATH as follows:

          % setenv JAIHOME $JAIDIR/jai-1_1_2_01/lib
          % setenv CLASSPATH $JAIHOME/jai_core.jar:$JAIHOME/jai_codec.jar:$JAIHOME/mlibwrapper_jai.jar:$CLASSPATH
          % setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH .:$JAIHOME:$CLASSPATH

   * Microsoft Windows Installation Instructions

     The downloaded objects are executable files. In Microsoft Windows, they
     are .exe files:
        o jai-1_1_2_01-lib-windows-i586.exe
        o jai-1_1_2_01-lib-windows-i586-jre.exe
        o jai-1_1_2_01-lib-windows-i586-jdk.exe
     To install the library files, double-click on the
     jai-1_1_2_01-lib-windows-i586.exe icon and follow the directions. This
     will install the library files into a default location C:\jai-1_1_2_01
     without any check for the JDK or the JRE

     To install the JRE version, double-click on the
     jai-1_1_2_01-lib-windows-i586-jre.exe icon and follow the directions.

     To install the JDK version, double-click on the
     jai-1_1_2_01-lib-windows-i586-jdk.exe icon and follow the directions.

     You may delete the jai-1_1_2_01-*.exe files after you are done with the
     extraction.

     IMPORTANT: The executable will try to install JAI within the latest JDK
     (or JRE) version that it finds. If you need to install and use JAI
     within another JDK (or JRE) version on disk, please make sure you enter
     a valid JDK directory when prompted.

   * Linux Installation Instructions

     The downloaded files are:
        o jai-1_1_2_01-lib-linux-i586-jdk.bin
        o jai-1_1_2_01-lib-linux-i586-jre.bin
        o jai-1_1_2_01-lib-linux-i586.tar.gz
     To install the JDK version for Linux, assuming:

          $JDK       is the path into the jdk1.3 (or a higher version),
          $downloaddir  is the directory into which you downloaded the .bin files.

     Run the following commands:

          % cd $JDK
          % chmod u+x $downloaddir/jai-1_1_2_01-lib-linux-i586-jdk.bin
          % $downloaddir/jai-1_1_2_01-lib-linux-i586-jdk.bin

     IMPORTANT: If you do not "cd" to the JDK1.3 (or higher version)
     directory before performing the extraction, then JAI will not work
     correctly. You may also need appropriate write permissions into the JDK
     directory in order to install.

     To install the JRE version for Linux, try

           % cd $JRE         ($JRE is the path into jre1.3 or later version.)
           % chmod u+x $downloaddir/jai-1_1_2_01-lib-linux-i586-jre.bin
           % $downloaddir/jai-1_1_2_01-lib-linux-i586-jre.bin

     IMPORTANT: If you do not "cd" to the JRE1.3 (or higher version)
     directory before performing the extraction, then JAI will not work
     correctly. You may also need appropriate write permissions into the JRE
     directory in order to install.

   * Sample Demos Installation Instructions

     The downloaded files are:
        o jai-1_1_2-Unix-sample.tar.gz
        o jai-1_1_2-windows-i586-sample.exe


     If you wish to install the sample files on Solaris/Linux, run the
     command:

     % gunzip -c $downloaddir/jai-1_1_2-Unix-sample.tar.gz | tar xf -

     On Windows: double-click on the jai-1_1_2-windows-i586-sample.exe icon
     and follow the directions.

   * Automatic Installation of JAI

     JavaTM Plug-in Technology establishes a connection between popular
     browsers and the JavaTM platform. The JavaTM Plug-in 1.4.2. Developer
     Guide discusses how to use the JavaTM Plug-in Component to enable
     applets in browsers. One of the capabilities provided by JavaTM Plug-in
     (JPI) is JavaTM extension deployment. The JPI installs or replaces the
     Java extensions (such as JAI) in your browser with an updated version.
     If a user's browser runs a Java program requiring an Optional Package,
     the JPI can be made to automatically download and run the Optional
     Package's installer. For more information please refer to the detailed
     instructions on how to deploy an applet which may deploy an Optional
     Package such as JAI.

     A JPI auto-installation download bundle for JAI is provided for each of
     the supported platforms:

        Platform             Download Bundle                 Contents
      solaris-sparcjai-1_1_2_01-solaris-sparc-jar.zip jai_solaris-sparc.jar
      solaris-i586 jai-1_1_2_01-solaris-i586-jar.zip  jai_solaris-i586.jar
      linux-i586   jai-1_1_2_01-linux-i586-jar.zip    jai_linux-i586.jar
      windows-i586 jai-1_1_2_01-windows-i586-jar.zip  jai_windows-i586.jar

     Each bundle is a Zip archive containing a signed JAI extension jar file
     which in turn contains a JAI JRE installer. The Implementation-URL
     attribute of the manifest of the applet jar file must refer to this
     signed jar file. Thus developers of applets which use auto-installation
     of JAI must unpack the Zip archive and place the jar file contained
     therein at the location specified by the Implementation-URL attribute
     of their applet jar file's Manifest. For example, the applet jar file's
     manifest might look like this

     Extension-List: jai_core
     jai_core-Extension-Name: javax.media.jai
     jai_core-Specification-Version: 1.1-mr
     jai_core-Implementation-Version: 1.1.2_01
     jai_core-Implementation-Vendor-Id: com.sun
     jai_core-Implementation-URL: http://mydomain.com/jai_solaris-sparc.jar

     if the solaris-sparc auto-installation jar file was being used and was
     located at the top level of the http://mydomain.com server.

     Note that the version of the JPI specified by an applet must match the
     version of JPI installed in the browser. Note also that installation
     will not succeed if the user does not have write permission for the JPI
     installation location. See also (Updating CLASSPATH, PATH, and
     LD_LIBRARY_PATH) for information related to the usage of the correct
     version of JPI.

     Updating CLASSPATH, PATH, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH

     If JAI is installed as part of the Java 2 SDK's Java Runtime
     Environment, no CLASSPATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH settings are required.
     When you encounter problems running JAI applications, it is most likely
     that you are not running the correct version of java (jdk). Check with
     the command "java -version" on Solaris or at Dos prompt. If needed, set
     the PATH correctly to use the correct version of JDK or JRE as
     follows.

     For Solaris:

     % setenv PATH $JDK/bin:$PATH;    or
     % setenv PATH $JRE/bin:$PATH

     The Java Plug-in must also be registered with the browser as described
     at http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/install-solaris.html#plugin. Note:
     The plugin used should be v1.3.1 or higher

     For Windows:

     A point to be noted on the Windows platform is that the Java2 SDK 1.3,
     by default, installs Java into both the JDK location:

     c:\jdk1.3

     and into the JRE location:

     C:\Program Files\JavaSoft\jre\1.3

     Additionally, a shortcut to java.exe is installed in the WINNT/System32
     (for NT systems) or Windows/System (for Windows 95 and 98) directory.

     Developers need to be aware of this when working with the Java 2 SDK.
     Unless the path to the 1.3 SDK jre\bin and bin directories is placed in
     the PATH environment variable in the same order, ahead of the system
     directory, the SDK's java.exe will not be executed. Any extensions
     (such as JAI) that are installed into the SDK but not into the JRE will
     not be found during program execution. The same applies to higher
     versions of the JDK.

     To set PATH environment variable, you may need to edit autoexec.bat on
     Windows 98/95. For other Windows systems, try click
     Start-Settings-ControlPanel, then double click on System. Choose
     Environment. Under System Variables, click on Path, and update its
     value to put

            c:\Program Files\JavaSoft\jre\1.3\bin;     or
            c:\jdk1.3\jre\bin;     or
            c:\jdk1.3\bin;

     ahead of others. Note that ";" is used to separate from other values.
     To double check, open a DOS command prompt and use "set" or "set path"
     to view the PATH environment variable.

     If you have used the CLASSPATH install into arbitrary location for
     Windows, then you will also need to set your CLASSPATH variable to
     point to each of the jai jar files in your installed directory

     Uninstall Instructions

        o Solaris/Linux Operating Environment

               % cd $JDK

               where $JDK is the path into the jdk1.3 (or a higher version)
               directory, where JAI was installed.

               % chmod u+x UNINSTALL-jai
               % ./UNINSTALL-jai

        o Microsoft Windows Operating Environment
               You would need to go to the Control Panel and double-click on
               Add/Remove Programs. Find the listing for Java Advanced
               Imaging 1.1.2_01 and click on Add/Remove. This should
               uninstall the library for you.

     Permission-Related Issues

        o Run Applets with MediaLib-Enabled

               On the Solaris platform, the following permission has to be
               added in the file java.policy located at $JRE/lib/security:

               permission java.io.FilePermission "/usr/bin/uname",
               "execute";

               For the other platforms, the mediaLib version is enabled by
               default .
        o File Permission for Decoding in Applets

               When FileCacheSeekableStream is used, either explicitly or
               implicitly, the permissions for the default temporary-file
               directory (defined by the system property "java.io.tmpdir")
               are necessary.  That is, add the following line into the
               proper policy file:

               permission java.io.FilePermission ${java.io.tmpdir}/*,
               "read,write,delete";
