This version of SLAMD requires an updated version of the Mozilla LDAP SDK for
Java.  The existing LDAP SDK for Java exhibits a bug under heavy load that can
cause operations to hang.  This problem has been experienced by many
individuals using SLAMD.

A patch has been made available to fix this problem.  In compliance with the
Netscape Public License (NPL) under which the Mozilla LDAP SDK for Java is
distributed, both the full source for the altered file as well as a context
diff that clearly illustrates the change, are provided with SLAMD.

The Mozilla LDAP SDK for Java is available in source form at
http://www.mozilla.org/directory/.  Any questions or coments regarding the
change that SLAMD has made to this SDK should be directed to
